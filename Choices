Cold nights spent inside my head
My days filled with dread
Trying to hold my tongue
So I don’t cough up my lung
To scream about the abuse
My heart already hung loose
Trying to bear the burden
My future left uncertain
Continue down the path of those before me
Or break free
If you were to chose
Would you choose the hard path,
Or the easy path?
