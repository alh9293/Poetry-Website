The locked box was her precious price
The key around her neck tied twice
No one would be permitted to glance
Though a boy came along in a prance
He showed an identical key
He was there to set her free
The frightened girl did what she was taught
She ran and fought…
The brave boy stayed for her
Even in the blur
She did not want his care
And it became too much for him to bare
The girl had to watch him stray away
She let out a pray
“I’m sorry.”
Because it was the end of their story.
