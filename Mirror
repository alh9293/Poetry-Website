I peer into my brother’s eyes
Deep inside rest his tears
Everytime I see his anger
I see someone I thought I never would
He has to have some good
But I can’t deny
A person  I can easily identify
My mom… A ticking time bomb
Waiting to blow
I keep my head low
He is the hidden truth deep within the walls of my life
I cut my tongue with a knife
Because each time anyone tries to help him
He shows the worst parts of her
A mirror of who I could become
And I plead that I am not her…
