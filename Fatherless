I still have a light turned on for you
Father you are far from view
Never there
My younger self wondering if you care
A daughter who grew up without her father
Her family told her not to bother
But I still wondered about him
I’m all grown up now my heart still on a broken limb
Of all the possibilities I could have had
I suppose I should be sad or mad
But lately I learned about you
Your childhood was filled with violence, so you knew
That sometimes the abused turn into the abusers
We are choosers
So I hope this finds you so you know I forgive you
