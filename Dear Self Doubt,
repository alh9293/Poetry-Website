The slight burning that starts as a dull ache
Until it begins to spread
Lighting a match within my mind
Making me question my abilities
My importance
My life
The underlying fear of failure
And questions of will I ever be good enough?
Smart enough?
Happy enough?
That small burn has spread into a wildfire
That refuses to stop spreading
Sinking into my being
