# Poetry-Website
My major project 2026. I got to play around with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and make something that truly works and looks appealing. 
I learned a lot about all three of the coding languages. I also learned that I should not format things on my website in pixels. 
I realized that when I was almost done and then had to change most of them to percentages to work on other computers. 
I learned you can do really cool effects for websites like the night and day mode of the background. I also got to make cute buttons.
I also learned how much actually goes into creating one website. I never truly realized until I wanted cool feautures like shimmering text, buttons for certain functionalities, and background changes.
I orginally thought it was just a little lines of code but now I know that is definitely not true. I really had fun with this as my major project.
