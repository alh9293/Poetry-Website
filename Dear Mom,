Childhood trauma etched to my soul
Endless nights locked in my room
Wondering
Praying to be enough
For a conversation
For you to know me
Sometimes I dream about you
Without meeting my father and me
It is the happiest I have ever seen you
No abuse…
No pain…
No arguments…
A bright and well-deserved future
I forgive you for continuing the trauma
