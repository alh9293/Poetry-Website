Form into a line
Pretending to be fine
The system is there for a reason
Thinking outside the box is treason

Don’t do it
Or you won’t be able to admit
That you are different
Which makes it adherent
To see the world as it is

Though is would be bliss
To be able to confine to that box
It isn’t the life you need to live
