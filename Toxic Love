My screams ring inside my mind
How could I have been so blind?
After everything you have done
All the lies you have spun
Everyone still believes you
You love me
You said it was true
Can’t you hear my plea
Why won’t you let me be
All I want to do is break free
Of all of the trauma
And get rid of your drama
But you won’t let me go
Because I will always go back to you…
And you know I will
